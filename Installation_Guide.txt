  3. module load conda                              (Only needed on Hipergator)
  4. conda create --name tiger_env h5py netcdf4 matplotlib scipy numpy pytest cmcrameri mpi4py
  5. conda activate tiger_env                       (This step needs to be run whenever you want to use TIGER in a new terminal)
  6. conda develop ~/projects/TIGER                 (Or your TIGER directory)
  7. conda install -c menpo opencv

Option B - Pip installation :
  3. module load python                             (Optional, needed on Hipergator )
  4. pip install matplotlib numpy scipy h5py netcdf4 opencv-python pytest cmcrameri mpi4py
  5. cd ~/projects/TIGER/
  6. export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/projects/TIGER (Or whichever location you cloned TIGER to.)


Importing modules from TIGER requires you to run step #6 every time you open the window. Alternatively you can copy that command into your bash profile (~/.bash_profile) using your choice of text editor. After copying the command, either restart the terminal window or run
